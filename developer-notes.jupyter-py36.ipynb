    "## Changing the Significant Event logic\n",
    "In 'Streaming Analytics for Life Event Prediction', we pick out *significant score change events* and publish these to an IBM Event Streams topic where they could be used to trigger automated  near real-time proactive responses. The significant event selection logic is defined in the streaming-analytics-lfe-pipeline notebook in: Class SignificantEvents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation of that class uses a high threshold (default value=0.5) and a low threshold (default value=0.4).\n",
    "A new score is considered significant if: \n",
    "*  this is the first score for this customer above the high threshold since one or more earlier scores below the low threshhold  \n",
    "*  or, this is the first score for this customer below the low threshold since one or more earlier scores above the high threshold for this customer. \n",
    "These rules for significant new scores are intended to capture when a customer is detected to be in a new state (where some novel policy action may be appropriate) and by requiring a threshold to be crossed, avoid noise and too much automated activity if a customer's scores are bouncing around a single threshold value. \n",
    "\n",
    "This significant score selection logic was picked to illustrate continuous monitoring of scores as they occur.  Any actual streaming analytics application will need its own specific significant score selection rules meeting the business needs of its context. The interested user should consider modifying the python functions in Class Significant Events and resubmitting the streaming_analytics_lfe_pipeline notebook to start a new streaming analytics simulation with modified rules for significant events.  \n"

    "## Streaming Analytics with live event input - alternate score repositories \n",
    "An ideal demonstration of the value of streaming analytics might show continuous scoring using a well defined machine learning model with known business value on a live stream of arriving events.  For the Life Event Prediction model we have used, there is no public live stream reporting continuous interactions of customers with a financial services firm as they occur.  Therefore, in The Streaming Analytics for LFE project, we have used a simulated \"live\" stream generated from some historical data.  The sample input files are included in the source datasets provided with the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important extension step for a user of this accelerator would be adapt the input to receive an appropriate stream of live events. \n",
    "A high level view of the pattern to accomplish this is provided in the Publish significant events cell of the streaming-analytics-lfe-pipeline.  In the function createPublishSignificantEventsTopology() \n",
    "*  credentials to access an IBM Event Streams topic are retrieved\n",
    "*  a publish command is issued to push an event to the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with a live input stream form a IBM Event Streams / Kafka one would use a similar credentials scheme and a subscribe command to the relevant input event topic rather than a publish. \n",
